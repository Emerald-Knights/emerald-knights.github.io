            Heainz was a member on EK from 2019-2020. He was a coder, but also did a lot of other tasks like making a capstone.
            He showed up to outreaches regularly, including one in Warren to teach 3rd graders. Apparently he had a girlfrind named Amber (no one was able to confirm this).
            He was deeply enthusiastic for code, and at the end of the season felt that transferring to FTC Team 15451 The Robotic Destriers of Livingston would be
            a better fit for him.

            Anthony was a builder from 2017-2021, and team captain from 2020-2021. Taught by the legendary David and Preston, Anthony quickly learned the ways of the build.
            He was a pro-driver on the field and
            was quick with the improvisational game strategies. His deep knowledge of build with robotics allowed him to
            clutch fix our robot when it was falling apart at the seams, which is like all the time. Always energetic,
            his energy very easily passed on to all the other members, making robotics not a chore but a fun way for people to spend time.
            His unorthodox teaching made him perfect for leading an unorthodox team, always going "you monkey".

            robotics was participating in community outreach and encouraging younger participants to develop an interest
            in STEM. In addition, it was under her and Gene's leadership that the EK group chat evolved from Whatsapp to Discord.
            Lucy also took the time to go to Riverdale and mentor the FTC team that Angelina was helping.

            A lot of the grunt work of writing our logs and making finance plans was done by Ethan.
